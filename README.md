RenderCV engine is a Typst-based Python package with a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to version-control your CV/resume as source code. It reads a CV written in a YAML file with Markdown syntax, converts it into a [Typst](https://typst.app) code, and generates a PDF.

RenderCV engine's focus is to provide these three features:

- **Content-first approach:** Users should be able to focus on the content instead of worrying about the formatting.
- **A mechanism to version-control a CV's content and design separately:** The content and design of a CV are separate issues and they should be treated separately.
- **Robustness:** A PDF should be delivered if there aren't any errors. If errors exist, they should be clearly explained along with solutions.


It takes a YAML file that looks like this:

```yaml
cv:
  name: John Doe
  location: Location
  email: john.doe@example.com
  phone: tel:+1-609-999-9995
  social_networks:
    - network: LinkedIn
      username: john.doe
    - network: GitHub
      username: john.doe
  sections:
    welcome_to_RenderCV!:
      - '[RenderCV](https://rendercv.com) is a Typst-based CV
        framework designed for academics and engineers, with Markdown
        syntax support.'
      - Each section title is arbitrary. Each section contains
        a list of entries, and there are 7 different entry types
        to choose from.
    education:
      - institution: Stanford University
        area: Computer Science
        degree: PhD
        location: Stanford, CA, USA
        start_date: 2023-09
        end_date: present
        highlights:
          - Working on the optimization of autonomous vehicles
            in urban environments
    ...
```

Then, it produces one of these PDFs with its corresponding Typst file, Markdown file, HTML file, and images as PNGs. Click on the images below to preview PDF files.

RenderCV comes with a JSON Schema so that the YAML input file can be filled out interactively.

## Getting Started

RenderCV engine is very easy to install (`pip install "rendercv[full]"`) and easy to use (`rendercv new "John Doe"`). Follow the [user guide](https://docs.rendercv.com/user_guide) to get started.

## Motivation

We are developing a [purpose-built app](https://rendercv.com) for writing CVs and resumes that will be available on mobile and web. This Python project is the foundation of that app. Check out [our blog post](https://rendercv.com/rendercv-latex-cv-framework/) to learn more about why one would use such an app.

## Contributing

All contributions to RenderCV are welcome! To get started, please read [the developer guide](https://docs.rendercv.com/developer_guide).
