RenderCV engine is a Python package with a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to version-control your CV as source code.

RenderCV engine's focus is to provide these three features:

- **Content-first approach:** CV writers should be able to focus on the content instead of worrying about the formatting.
- **A mechanism to version-control a CV's content and design separately:** The content and design are version-controlled as a source code completely separately.
- **Robustness:** A robust system that always delivers a PDF if there aren't any errors. If there are errors, it provides clear explanations and solutions.


It takes a YAML file that looks like this:

```yaml
cv:
  name: John Doe
  location: Your Location
  email: youremail@yourdomain.com
  sections:
    this_is_a_section_title:
      - This is a type of entry, TextEntry—just a plain string.
      - You may have as many entries as you want under a section.
      - RenderCV offers a variety of entry types such as TextEntry,
        BulletEntry, EducationEntry, ExperienceEntry, NormalEntry,
        OneLineEntry, PublicationEntry.
      - Each entry type has its own set of attributes and different
        looks.
    my_education_section:
      - institution: Boğaziçi University
        area: Mechanical Engineering
        degree: BS
        start_date: 2024-09
        end_date: 2029-05
        highlights:
          - "GPA: 3.9/4.0 ([Transcript](https://example.com))"
          - "**Coursework:** Structural Analysis, Thermodynamics,
            Heat Transfer"
    experience: ...
```

Then, it produces one of these PDFs with its corresponding $\LaTeX$ code, Markdown file, HTML file, and images as PNGs. Click on the images below to preview PDF files.

RenderCV comes with a JSON Schema so that the YAML input file can be filled out interactively.

## Quick Start Guide

RenderCV engine is very easy to install (`pip install rendercv`) and easy to use (`rendercv new "John Doe"`). Follow the [user guide](https://docs.rendercv.com/user_guide) to get started.

## Motivation

We are developing a purpose-built app for writing CVs and resumes that will be available on mobile and web. This Python project is the foundation of that app. Check out [our blog post](https://rendercv.com/rendercv-latex-cv-framework/) to learn more about why one would use such an app.
