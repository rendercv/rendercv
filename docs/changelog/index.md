English strings can be overridden with `locale_catalog` section in the YAML input file ([#26](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/26), [#20](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/pull/20)). See the [documentation](user_guide/structure_of_the_yaml_input_file.md#locale_catalog-field) for more information.
- PNG files for each page can be generated now ([#57](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/57)).
- `rendercv new` command now generates Markdown and $\LaTeX$ source files in addition to the YAML input file so that the default templates can be modified easily.
- A new CLI command has been added, `rendercv create-theme`, to allow users to create their own themes easily.
  ```bash
  rendercv create-theme "customtheme" --based-on "classic"
  ```
- [A developer guide](https://docs.rendercv.com/developer_guide/) has been written.
- New options have been added to the `rendercv render` command:
    - `--output-folder-name "OUTPUT_FOLDER_NAME"`: Generates the output files in a folder with the given name. By default, the output folder name is `rendercv_output`. The output folder will be created in the current working directory. ([#58](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/58))
    - `--latex-path LATEX_PATH`: Copies the generated $\LaTeX$ source code from the output folder and pastes it to the specified path.
    - `--pdf-path PDF_PATH`: Copies the generated PDF file from the output folder and pastes it to the specified path.
    - `--markdown-path MARKDOWN_PATH`: Copies the generated Markdown file from the output folder and pastes it to the specified path.
    - `--html-path HTML_PATH`: Copies the generated HTML file from the output folder and pastes it to the specified path.
    - `--png-path PNG_PATH`: Copies the generated PNG files from the output folder and pastes them to the specified path.

    - `--dont-generate-png`: Prevents the generation of the PNG files.
    - `--ANY.LOCATION.IN.THE.YAML.FILE "VALUE"`: Overrides the value of `ANY.LOCATION.IN.THE.YAML.FILE` with `VALUE`. This option can be used to avoid storing sensitive information in the YAML file. Sensitive information, like phone numbers, can be passed as a command-line argument with environment variables. This method is also beneficial for creating multiple CVs using the same YAML file by changing only a few values.
- New options have been added to the `rendercv new` command:
    - `--dont-create-theme-source-files`: Prevents the creation of the theme source files. By default, the theme source files are created.
