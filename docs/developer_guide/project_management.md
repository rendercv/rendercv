# Project Management

This guide explains how RenderCV is managed as a Python project - why we need more than just Python code, and how all the pieces fit together.

## What is "Project Management"?

When you look at RenderCV's repository, you see:

```
.
├── src/           ← The actual RenderCV code
├── tests/         ← Tests for that code
├── docs/          ← Documentation
├── .github/       ← CI/CD automation
├── pyproject.toml ← Project configuration
├── justfile       ← Command shortcuts
└── ...many other files
```

**Project management is everything except `src/`.** It's all the infrastructure that lets us:

- Share RenderCV with users (`pip install rendercv`)
- Manage dependencies consistently
- Automate testing, building, and releases
- Ensure reproducibility across machines and time

## Why Can't We Just Write Python Code?

Imagine RenderCV is just Python files in `src/`. You want to share it. Here's what breaks:

### Problem 1: Distribution

**How do users get your code?**

You could tell them "download these files and run them". But users want `pip install rendercv` and have it work instantly.

**This requires:** Packaging your code and uploading to PyPI (Python Package Index).

### Problem 2: Dependencies

RenderCV uses `pydantic`, `jinja2`, `typer`, and more. Without them, it doesn't work.

You could tell users "install these packages...". But which versions? How do you ensure everyone has compatible versions?

**This requires:** Declaring dependencies so pip installs them automatically.

### Problem 3: Reproducibility

- Developer A installs today, gets pydantic 2.10
- Developer B installs next month, gets pydantic 2.11 with a breaking change
- Code works on A's machine, breaks on B's machine
- User reports a bug from 6 months ago - how do you recreate their environment?

**This requires:** Locking exact versions of every package.

### The Solution

Modern Python projects use:

- **Package manager** ([uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)) - Handles dependencies and environments
- **Project file** (`pyproject.toml`) - Declares what the project needs
- **Lock file** (`uv.lock`) - Records exact versions
- **Build tools** - Package code for distribution
- **Automation** (GitHub Actions) - Test and deploy automatically

Let's look at how RenderCV uses these.

## Files and Folders in the Root

This section explains each file and folder you see in RenderCV's root directory.

### [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/blob/main/pyproject.toml)

**The project definition.** This file declares:

- Project metadata (name, version, description)
- Dependencies (what packages RenderCV needs)
- Optional dependencies (CLI tools that only work outside web environments)
- Entry points (makes `rendercv` a command)
- Build configuration (how to package RenderCV)
- Tool settings (ruff, pyright, pytest, etc.)

Open `pyproject.toml` to see the full configuration with detailed comments.

### [`uv.lock`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/blob/main/uv.lock)

**Dependency lock file.** Records the exact version of every package (including dependencies of dependencies).

This file is **automatically generated by uv** - you never edit it manually.

**Always commit this to git** - it ensures everyone has identical environments.

### [`justfile`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/blob/main/justfile)

**What is it?** [just](https://github.com/casey/just) is a command runner - a tool that lets you define commands in a file and run them easily.

**Why?** During development, you need to run many commands repeatedly:

- Run tests
- Format code
- Build documentation
- Update schema

Instead of remembering and typing these commands every time, we define them once in `justfile` and run them with simple names:

```bash
just test           # Runs pytest with the right options
just format         # Formats code with ruff
just serve-docs     # Builds and serves documentation locally
just update-schema  # Regenerates schema.json
```

**How it helps RenderCV:** Standardizes development commands across all contributors. Everyone uses the same commands with the same options. See [index.md](index.md#available-commands) for all available commands.

### [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml)

**What is it?** Configuration for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) - a tool that runs code quality checks.

**What are the checks?**

- Code formatting (ruff)
- Spell checking (codespell)

**How we use it in RenderCV:**

1. **Locally:** When you run `just check`, it runs pre-commit to check your code
2. **In CI/CD:** [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci/) automatically checks every pull request and push (free for open source projects)

We don't use pre-commit as actual git hooks (checks before every commit) - we prefer running checks manually with `just check` when ready.

### [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/blob/main/.gitignore)

**Files git ignores.** Tells git to never track:

- Generated files (`.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `build/`, `dist/`)
- Test artifacts (`.pytest_cache/`, `.coverage`)
- Environment-specific files (`.DS_Store`, `.vscode/`)

Source files (`.py`, `.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`) ARE tracked.

### [`docs/`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/tree/main/docs) and [`mkdocs.yaml`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/blob/main/mkdocs.yaml)

**The problem:** We want documentation on a website (`https://docs.rendercv.com`), not just Markdown files in a repository.

**The solution:** [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) - a tool that converts Markdown files into a static website (HTML/CSS files we can host).

**How it works:**

1. Write documentation in Markdown files inside `docs/`:
   ```
   docs/
   ├── index.md           # Homepage
   ├── user_guide/        # For users
   ├── developer_guide/   # For contributors
   └── api_reference/     # Auto-generated from docstrings
   ```

2. Configure MkDocs in `mkdocs.yaml` (theme, navigation, plugins, etc.)

3. Run `just serve-docs` to build and preview the website locally

4. GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys to `https://docs.rendercv.com` on every commit

See [Documentation](documentation.md) for details on how documentation works in RenderCV.

### [`schema.json`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/blob/main/schema.json)

**What is it?** A [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) - a standard way to describe the structure and validation rules of JSON/YAML files.

**Why?** When users edit RenderCV YAML files in VS Code, they get:

- Autocomplete for field names
- Inline documentation for each field
- Real-time validation errors

**How?** VS Code reads `schema.json` to understand what fields are allowed, what types they should be, and what they mean.

**Where it comes from:** Auto-generated from RenderCV's pydantic models with `just update-schema`. The pydantic models define the structure, and we export them to JSON Schema format that VS Code understands.

### [`README.md`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/blob/main/README.md)

**Project homepage.** The first thing people see on GitHub. Contains:

- What RenderCV does
- Installation instructions
- Quick example
- Links to documentation

### [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/blob/main/LICENSE)

**MIT License.** Open source, permissive - anyone can use, modify, and distribute RenderCV.

### [`src/rendercv/`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/tree/main/src/rendercv)

**The actual RenderCV implementation.**

```
src/rendercv/
├── cli/        # Command-line interface
├── renderer/   # Typst generation, PDF compilation
└── schema/     # Data models and validation
```

See [Understanding RenderCV](understanding_rendercv.md) for how the code works. For why we use the `src/` layout, see the [Python packaging guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/src-layout-vs-flat-layout/).

### [`tests/`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/tree/main/tests)

**Test files.** Automated tests that verify RenderCV works correctly.

Structure mirrors `src/rendercv/`:

```
tests/
├── cli/        # Tests for src/rendercv/cli/
├── renderer/   # Tests for src/rendercv/renderer/
└── schema/     # Tests for src/rendercv/schema/
```

Run with `just test`. See [Testing](testing.md) for details on how testing works in RenderCV.

### [`scripts/`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/tree/main/scripts)

**Maintenance scripts.** Python scripts for project tasks:

- `update_schema.py` - Generate `schema.json`
- `update_examples.py` - Regenerate example PDFs
- `create_executable.py` - Build standalone executable

Run via `just` commands.

### [`examples/`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/tree/main/examples)

**Example YAML files and outputs.** Used for documentation and testing.

### [`.github/workflows/`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/tree/main/.github/workflows)

CI/CD pipelines (run tests, build docs, publish to PyPI). See [CI/CD](ci_cd.md) for details.

## Key Takeaways

**Project management is everything outside `src/`** - the infrastructure that makes RenderCV a complete Python project.

**The goal:** Make it easy to write, test, document, package, and share Python code that works reliably for everyone.
